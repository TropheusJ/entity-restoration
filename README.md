# Entity Restoration
Lets you copy all entities from one world to another, intended for when you accidentally kill @e.

To use, use `/entityRestoration save` to save entities in one world, and `/entityRestoration load` to load them into another.

SAVING WILL TAKE A WHILE. It loads a 100x100 chunk radius around the command sender in order to catch as many entities as possible.
